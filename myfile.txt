Officials in Hubei province have come under fire for their handling of the virus outbreak, including causing confusion by changing the criteria used to count the number of cases. The death toll from the coronavirus has reached 28 in South Korea with 600 newly confirmed cases, raising the national tally to 4,812 cases, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a news release Tuesday. However, infectious disease specialists at Imperial College London estimate about two thirds of cases originating in mainland China remain undetected worldwide. The jump in the number of daily confirmed cases internationally has raised fears the outbreak could become a pandemic - when an infectious disease spreads easily from person to person in many parts of the world. Some governments have halted flights from virus-hit nations, locked down towns, urged people to stay at home and suspended major events. New cases announced in China have remained low over recent days, compared with numbers seen in early-mid February, according to official figures. Hubei province the center of the outbreak - remains the worst affected, seeing by far the biggest number of cases of the virus. Coronavirus has infected about 10,000 people outside China, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures. Wuhan continues to account for the majority of new cases and deaths in China. The number of deaths announced each day by the Chinese authorities has been falling for most of the last few days.
